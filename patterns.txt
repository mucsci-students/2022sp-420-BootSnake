Design Patterns

1. Iterator: Our ClassSearch method iterates through a list of AClass objects to find the class of the given name.
   (Location: classModel.py)

2. Facade: The AClass object is a facade that contains subsystems of methods, fields, and relationships.
   (Location: classModel.py)

3. Command: Our GUI uses buttons that are linked to commands.
   (Location: interfaceGUIView.py)

4. Observer: When a class is renamed, all relationships dependent on the given class are made to set its old name to match 
   the new name.
